# TimeClock

Google AppsScript project bound to a spreadsheet for recording time worked. It is used to verify that my actual time matches employer's time clock. 
The project is deployed as a web app to serve as a convenient front end. Developed locally using [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp).
